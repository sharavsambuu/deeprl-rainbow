This is an attempt at faithfully recreating the set of DQN variants discussed in the paper "[Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298)".  I made this as part of my work getting up to speed in Deep RL under a grant from the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/).

If all prerequisites are installed, can be run in the default configuration on Pong by typing "python rainbow.py".
